Project Overview
In this project, I developed a communication system between MATLAB and Arduino using serial data transmission. This setup allows real-time data exchange, making it useful for sensor monitoring, actuator control, and data visualization applications.

The project focuses on establishing a reliable and efficient serial connection, ensuring data integrity and minimizing latency issues.

Features
Bidirectional Serial Communication: Enables MATLAB to send and receive data from Arduino in real-time.

Sensor Data Acquisition: Reads values from connected sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, accelerometers).

Actuator Control: Allows MATLAB to send commands to control motors, LEDs, or other devices.

Data Processing & Visualization: MATLAB scripts process incoming data and generate plots or real-time graphs.

Error Handling & Synchronization: Implements checksums or validation mechanisms to ensure data accuracy.

How It Works
Arduino Setup:

Reads sensor data or waits for control commands.

Sends/receives serial data to/from MATLAB.

MATLAB Interface:

Opens a serial port connection to Arduino.

Receives and processes data for visualization.

Sends commands to Arduino for actuation.

Hardware & Software Requirements
Arduino Board (Uno, Mega, or compatible)

Sensors or Actuators (depending on the application)

MATLAB (with the Instrument Control Toolbox for serial communication)

USB Cable for Arduino-PC connection

Installation & Usage
1. Setting Up Arduino
Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the board.

Ensure the correct baud rate is set (e.g., 9600, 115200).

2. Running the MATLAB Script
Open MATLAB and run the script serial_data.m.

Select the correct COM port for your Arduino.

Start monitoring or sending commands.

Future Improvements
Implementing a GUI in MATLAB for user-friendly control.

Adding wireless communication (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) to replace USB.

Expanding support for multiple sensors and actuators.
